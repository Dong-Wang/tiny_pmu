Tiny PMU is a simple tool to access Intel Performance Monitor Unit. Unlike Intel vTune and perf,
Tiny PMU only run in Linux kernel space and depends on msr.h.

We write this tool for the Intel CPU users who still use old Linux kernel like 2.6.26 or customized
Linux which can't run vTune and perf.

Anyway, vTune and perf are the greatest performance profiling tools, you should use them as possible
as you can.

Tiny PMU has been validaed on Linux 2.6.26 and later Linux.

Tiny PMU only support Skylake
